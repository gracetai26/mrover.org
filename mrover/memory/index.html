    <p>The MRover team would like to honor the memory of Jacqueline Tardif, 
        a graduate of Michigan’s Aerospace Engineering Program and former MRover 
        president, who passed away due to Covid-19 complications in January of 2021. </p>

    <p>Jackie served as team lead from 2010 to 2013. She was extremely devoted to 
        her work and was responsible for much of the team’s foundations in its early 
        days. We owe MRover’s official establishment as a WSTPC team to Jackie as 
        well as the funding needed to build the team’s first few rovers which she 
        worked hard to amass.</p>

    <p>Following her graduation, Jackie went on to work as a lead mechanical 
        engineer for the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California, designing 
        and building satellites, two of which were launched into orbit from the 
        International Space Station. Additionally, Jackie devoted herself to working 
        with special needs children through horseback riding and STEM outreach programs 
        in her spare time.</p>

    </p>Jackie's full obituary as well as links to pages to make donations to Ride to Fly and 
        the National Math and Science Initiative in Jackie's name can be found
