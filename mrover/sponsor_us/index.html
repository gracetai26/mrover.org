        <h3>Sponsorships</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="sponsor_us_wrapper">
        MRover relies on sponsorships and donations to fund all of our activities throughout the year.
        In particular, we use funds to:
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>purchase materials</li>
            <li>create prototypes</li>
            <li>improve our toolset</li>
            <li>organize outreach events</li>
            <li>send the team to competition</li>
        </ul>

        As we ramp up our outreach efforts, plan more prototypes, and look into going to additional competitions,
        our team budget is rising. We would appreciate your support to
        help us continue our growth as a team.

        <br /><br />
