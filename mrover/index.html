                <h4>Who we are</h4>
                <p>The Michigan Mars Rover team (MRover) is a student-run, multidisciplinary organization whose mission is to
                    design, build, and test a rover for the exploration of extraterrestrial environments and to assist astronauts
                    on a mission to Mars. Our members consist of everyone from freshman to graduates that represent a range
                    of majors from the College of Engineering and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. We strive
                    to inspire and educate students about space, Mars exploration, and engineering in general, and we focus
                    on promoting good engineering practices and multidisciplinary design and helping students grow as engineers.</p>

                <p>MRover is a competition-oriented team whose goal is to compete in and win the University Rover Challenge
                    (URC) that takes place every year at the Mars Society's Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville,
                    Utah. The competition has gained worldwide attention from academia and industry, and teams from all over
                    the globe come to compete. This year, the URC will be hosting 30 teams from seven countries around the
                    world, and the Michigan Mars Rover Team is only one of twelve representing the United States.</p>
