desc:   Starting with the designs from the 2015 rover, Golu Golu's mechanical systems innovated on the prior year's in several ways. 
        Golu Golu marked the start of a transition away from a linearly actuated arm, using motors and geartrains for all segments except the upper arm.

        Our software this year was an improved version of the previous year's as well. With Golu Golu's more complex arm, the team had 
        to develop a more advanced control scheme for the robotic arm.
