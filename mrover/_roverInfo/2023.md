    - After competing at CIRC for the very first time and URC for the first time since COVID-19 our team was back and ready to work hard to build our best rover yet! Similar to previous years, Dahliaâ€™s electrical system remains accessible and serviceable. A battery and BMS provide power and protection to the rover, while the electrical box contains electronics needed for operation. A custom built power distribution PCB steps down voltages for various rover operations, and the custom built MCU board controls signals to the arm motors, instruments and sample handling box, and LEDs to successfully carry out mission tasks. Two radio configurations at different frequencies ensures efficient operation for different missions up to 2km. In terms of new software developments; Dahlia uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) consuming IMU orientation and multi-band GPS translation updates to predict and refine a smooth global transform. Visual odometry is used to produce 25 hz transform for localized tasks where accuracy is paramount, such as traversing the gate. Moteus brushless controllers have been integrated to provide reliable velocity control to the wheelbase. Our mechanical branch also made many new design decisions. Including a modified the welded torsion box to highly optimize for mass and load cases, a redesigned arm cycloidal gearboxes to efficiently transfer torque across joints using brushless motors, implementing a slip ring to allow infinite rotations of the end effector, and adding a sample acquisition subsystem that consists of a 3 degree of freedom robotic arm and end effector to scoop soil. Dahlia also features a optimized carousel system by modifying actuators and camera mounting, designed for a new chemical test, and added a sample cache to ISH. Finally the mechanical team tested new tire treads for increasing traction and reduced slop in mobility joints on Dahlia. The astrobiology team implemented 3 new tests to determine extant, extinct, and no life presence in soil samples. These tests included a ninhydrin test which tests for amino acids, ethanol autofluorescence test which tests for chlorophyll, and emulsion test which tests for lipids. 
    - Dahlia received an SAR score of 92.21 and finished fourth at URC with an overall score of 343.08!
