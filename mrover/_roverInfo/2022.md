    - In 2022 our team of roughly 80 members was back in person and ready to build our greatest rover yet! New 3D printed wheels are powerful and highly durable, allowing Rosie to traverse rough terrain with great agility. The rocker-bogie wheel configuration and differential bar work together to keep the lightweight chassis level, and her robotic arm switches easily between different segment and end effector combinations to serve specific missions. In addition to manual, open-loop control, the robotic arm utilizes our closed-loop inverse kinematics algorithm to move itself to precise positions. Rosie’s electrical box is highly organized and serviceable, equipped with a strong battery to power through long missions. The electrical system is well-interfaced with the mechanical system through careful wire-routing and EBox dampening measures, and her communications system allows for remote operation from distances up to 2km even with line-of-sight obstructions and elevation changes. Our embedded hardware and software systems utilize custom PCBs to control sensors and mechanisms, and onboard processors monitor functions to protect against potential electrical issues. A base station real-time kinematics program monitors and corrects Rosie’s position to direct her to distant locations with centimeter-level precision, and a rotating gimbal and camera system provide camera input to quickly determine obstacle-free paths. Even further, Rosie can use this capability to identify and travel to targets and through gates in a specified order. Rosie’s science system consists of eight different tests to determine the presence of extinct, extant, and absent life. In addition to chemical tests of collected soil samples, Rosie utilizes an actuated microscope and spectrophotometer, and a custom-built Raman spectrometer. 
    - Rosie received an SAR score of 90.97 and finished FIRST at URC with an overall score of 388.97!
