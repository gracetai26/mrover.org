    - Logistical challenges presented by this highly-remote school year influenced our rover’s design, with an added emphasis on making all systems highly manufacturable and easily serviceable. We switched to a welded-aluminum chassis this year, as opposed to carbon fiber, and incorporated a rocker-bogie suspension system and 3D-printed wheels to make it more suited to rocky and uneven terrain. We built upon our Robotic Arm’s custom cycloid transmission system and enhanced usability by adding lasers for depth perception and multiple camera views, and implementing more user-friendly controllers. Blue houses our most advanced electrical system yet with an extendable signal range via custom radio repeater, PCB designs that provide additional system monitoring capabilities and a custom, rechargeable battery. Our science system features numerous life determination methods including Raman spectroscopy, amino acid, chlorophyll, protein and pH chemical tests and an actuated microscope. Furthermore, our soil acquisition system is designed to precisely deliver three separate soil samples without cross-contamination of samples or site.
    - Though URC was cancelled this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we were still judged on our SAR submission, receiving a score of 93.09/100!
