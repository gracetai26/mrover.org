    - MRover was founded in 2000, then known as the Michigan Mars Rover Design Project. Our purpose was to design, build, and test a prototype of a pressurized rover for a manned Mars expedition while inspiring and educating people about space expoloration. We named our original concept Olympus after the highest point on Mars, and the team explored key elements of design - powering, propulsion, life support, etc. The design was entered into a Mars Society competition, and team won $10,000 to build a prototype.
