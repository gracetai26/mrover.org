    - Our next project after Everest took our team back to our origin in concept development. We were thinking about a chassis that was more modular - a platform that was all set up with power, communications, control, etc and could be outfitted as necessary for a given task, such as storage, scientific analysis, or crew transport. 
    - We evaluated tasks that Mars rovers would have to complete based on estimated mass and energy requirements and grouped them based on the size of chassis that would be required to meet those requirements. In the end, we developed small, medium, and large versions of our Universal Chassis. We went to the RASCAL Forum in 2005 and got 2nd place for the concept. Overall, the idea was to experiment with and develop ideas for systems involving radio communication, autonomy, robot arms, and chassis frames.
