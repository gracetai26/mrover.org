    - This year, we continued with the success of our four-wheeled rover from last year with shock absorbing systems. We developed heavy-duty rockers that allowed our rover to easily traverse rocky or uneven terrain. We decided to completely redo our arm to utilize inverse kinematics to take full advantage of the seven degrees of freedom we had available to us, allowing our operators to have a much more seamless experience. We also upgraded our soil acquisition system to have two individual science boxes, with associated separate drills and tubing in order to ensure that any soil samples we collected remained separated. 
    - We made many steps forward on the science front that eventually allowed us to get a perfect score on science at URC. As a partnership between mechanical and science, we designed and fabricated a Raman spectrometer to analyze soil samples without needing to collect them. We also installed a microscope to identify life without collection as well. For the soil we collected, we included ammonia and chlorophyll based tests to detect signs of life.
