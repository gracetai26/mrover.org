    - Our 2014 design made large strides from our 2013 design, and is the first rover to have the apperance of our current rovers. We began using boxes from Protocase to house our electrical components and shifted from pneumatic tires to the rubber tread tires we would use for years to come.

    - At URC 2014, our rover placed 16th overall.
