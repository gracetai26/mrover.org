    - In 2017, the URC introduced the autonomous navigation task, adding an entirely new dimension to the competition. To test autonomy code          without having a fully equipped rover, we used the simulation features of the Robot Operating System.
    - Mechanically speaking, Hughey was an improved version of the previous model, using a similar chassis and rocker-bogie suspension. Most changes were small adjustments, such as upgrading the fram from aluminum to carbon fiber. The most significant change was the separation of the soil acquisition subsystem from the robotic arm. We alse replaced the large linear actuator on the upper arm with motor and geartrain, completing our transition from linear actuation of the arm.

<!-- Maybe mention the complete software rewrite and/or adoptions of ROS? -->

<!--maybe remove the line about upgrading from aluminum to carbon fiber and the one before it -->
