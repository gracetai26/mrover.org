    - With the experience from 2010 and a tripled budget, we put together a larger, more competitive rover in 2011. Continuing our separation of mechanical and electrical teams, we broke the team down further into 6 core project systems - base station and control, communication, navigation and cameras, frame design, mobility, and arm design. Our team was still relatively small, consisiting of about 10 people.  
    - Leonardo was still pretty rudimentary, though a sizeable step forward from Walle. It consisted of 6 motors directly driving 6 wheels, a semi-articulated platform for 4 of the wheels to better navigate the terrain, several cameras, and a robotic arm. We gave it the name "Leonardo" due to the outer the frame's similarity to a turtle shell.
