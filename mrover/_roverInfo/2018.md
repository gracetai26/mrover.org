    - This year, we decided to give our subsystems a major overhaul. We abandoned the six-wheeled "rocker-bogie" suspension system in favor of a system that would allow us to travel faster - four independent shock absorbers and a differential bar. To give us more room for subsystems, we substantially increased the size of the chassis. Additionally, we designed our sample acquisition drill and robotic arm from the ground up, applying lessons learned in past years to produce brand new designs.
    - With the largest number of programmers in MRover history, we undertook the task of rewriting the entire codebase to create a maintainable codebase to use for years to come. This time, instead of using the Robot Operating System, we developed simpler software more focused on our needs. This included developing our own simulators to rapidly test code. We also implemented an "edge computing" approach, dividing up computing between many small computers and microcontrollers on the rover.
    - At URC 2018, Phoebe placed 9th overall.

<!-- could also mention the split electronics boxes, or new mast design, or many other things -->
<!-- consider abandoning the detail about the ROS -->
