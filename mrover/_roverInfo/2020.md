    - This year, we focused our attention to the durability and reliability of our four-wheeled rover, while continuing our previous successes. We developed our mobility system with a carbon-fiber chassis to allow for a strong, lightweight foundation. We also revamped the system with more powerful brushless DC motors to climb steeper slopes, and a suspension that is optimized to better absorb impact on all the wheels. We continued our improvements from last year’s arm by developing an in-house cycloidal transmission, increasing end effector precision while reducing overall mass of the rover.
    - Additionally, we completely overhauled the rover’s electrical system to support the mechanical and software updates, while giving us reliable communication and power. We developed our own 10-Series battery back to provide ample power to the rover. To ensure constant communication with the base station, we developed an autonomously deployable radio repeater for our long-range mission. 
    - Due to COVID-19, URC 2020 was cancelled after SAR submission. Based on SAR results, Lucy was the top URC 2020 qualifier.
