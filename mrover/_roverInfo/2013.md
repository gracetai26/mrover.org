    - Our 2013 model was an upgraded version of our effective 2012 model. We changed our rover back to a six-wheeled design once again, employing a modified version of our 2011 suspension system. We began constucting our electrical boxes out of lighter material, allowing us to use more of our alotted mass on other subsystems.
