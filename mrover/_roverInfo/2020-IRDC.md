    - In summer 2020, Mars Society South Asia hosted the first ever Indian Rover Design Challenge.  This was a completely virtual design competition with the goal of designing a Mars-worthy rover.  A portion of our team woked over the course of 3 months to research the surface of Mars and apply the research to design a rover worthy of operating on the surface of the planet.  
    - With things like dust, temperature, and radiation to take into account, we have designed an enclosed chassis with pannel specfically designed to protect all key systems from dust and extreme temperatures.  We chose a rocker-bogey suspension to better handle the surface.  We have also revamped our servicing and science arm designs with new transimissions.  Our software team has designed a state machine to continually track the condition of the rover and autonomously adjust to dangers it may encounter during it's 15 sol mission.
    - If you would like to read our final design report, please email the team Public relations officer.  We are currently awaiting the results of the competition, and will update this page as soon as they are available.
