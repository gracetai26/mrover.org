    - Our next step after Olympus was to turn our design into a prototype. The team acquired a 4x4 military truck platform and retrofitted it to realize our manned rover design. Essentially, the design consisted of a box cabin on the back of the truck that was outfitted with bunks, a bathroom, a lab bench, and other scientific equipment. They called the prototype Everest, and they drove it to the Mars Desert Research Station to test it.
