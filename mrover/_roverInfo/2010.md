    - In 2010, MRover competed in our first URC, deciding that an annual competition would give our team a more well-defined goal and an incentive to design, build, and test on a regular schedule. We designed a simple rover consisting of an open-top steel frame, 2 motors with chain drive,  4 wheels, no suspension, an onboard laptop, and a rudimentary arm.
    - At this phase of URC there were no more than 10 teams in the competition, though the field was still international.  We got to see the tasks and other rovers firsthand, learning what we could do in coming years to improve our performance.
