### Notes on sponsor images ###

For performance, make sure all sponsor images are no larger than they need to be to look good

As of 6/24/18, that amount apears to be around 800px

Using 8-bit color on large PNG files is a good way to reduce size

JPG files will shrink rapidly if you decrease the quality by just a little bit (not even noticeable to viewers)

Recommend using Pain.NET for all these (the Save As feature contains these tools as well as a file size indicator)
